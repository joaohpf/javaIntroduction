# Java Learning Repository ‚òïÔ∏è

Welcome to my **Java Learning Repository**!  
This repository contains Java exercises organized by topic and difficulty. It is designed to track my progress and practice coding in a structured way.

## Repository Structure

- **fundamentos/** ‚Äì Fundamental Java exercises
