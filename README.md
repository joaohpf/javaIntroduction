# Java Learning Repository ☕️

Welcome to my **Java Learning Repository**!  
This repository contains Java exercises organized by topic and difficulty. It is designed to track my progress and practice coding in a structured way.

## Repository Structure

- **fundamentos/** – Fundamental Java exercises  
  - **praticar-println/** – Basic output exercises using `System.out.println`  
  - **use-scanner/** – Exercises using `Scanner` for user input  
  - **variables/** – Exercises to practice variables, types, and assignments
  - **control-flow/** - 

Each folder contains multiple `.java` files, gradually increasing in complexity, so you can see the learning progression.

## How to Use

1. Open each `.java` file to study or run the code.
2. Feel free to clone or download the repository to practice on your own computer.

## Goals

- Learn and reinforce Java fundamentals
- Practice basic input/output and variable handling
- Gradually increase coding complexity
- Build a portfolio of practice exercises
